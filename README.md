# OddOccurrencesInArray
Given an array with an odd number of elements, where all but one element has a matching pair, return the value with no pair.
For example:
int[] A = {9,3,9,3,9,7,9};
A[0] is paired with A[2] = 9
A[1] is paired with A[3] = 3
A[4] is paired with A[6] = 9
A[5] = 7 is the element whose value has no pair, so the expected output is 7.
